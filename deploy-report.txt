RuneAI Deployment Report

Date: 2025-11-29
Branch: feature/runeai-p0-fixes

Completed Tasks:

P0.1 — Fix Delete/Unsubscribe semantics and UI
- Hide `Unsubscribe` in card menu for non-subscribed links by default and toggle based on current subscription state.
- `Unsubscribe` now only sets `enabled=false` for the subscription and does not delete the link or digest entries.
- `Delete` now removes the saved link, deletes its subscription entry, and cleans related entries in `rune_digests`.
- Confirmation copy updated to English:
  - Unsubscribe: Title: Unsubscribe from "{title}"? Text: You will no longer receive AI digests for this site.
  - Delete: Title: Delete saved link "{title}"? Text: This will remove the link and its related digest entries.
Files: js/features/dashboard.js

P0.2 — Prevent digests for deleted links
- Daily and single digest generation always read subscriptions from storage fresh.
- Delete now removes the subscription entry, so deleted links never appear in future digests.
Files: js/features/dashboard.js, js/main.js

P0.3 — English-only UI copy
- Replaced remaining Chinese user-facing strings in scheduler/digest toasts and fallbacks.
  - Toast: Merged digest updated (... sites)
  - Fallback summary: Mock: Summary placeholder
  - Error summary: Fetch failed
Files: js/main.js

QA Steps:
1) Add a link, subscribe it, generate a digest; verify digest entry appears.
2) Unsubscribe via menu → confirm dialog appears in English; digest generation no longer includes the site, existing digest entries remain.
3) Delete the saved link → confirm dialog appears in English; link is removed from cards, its subscription entry is deleted, and related digest entries are cleaned.
4) Trigger Daily Digest (Dev scheduler or manual Generate Today's Digest) → deleted links never appear.
5) Search UI for Chinese copy → none remains; all user-facing text is English.

Notes:
- Historical digest entries remain on Unsubscribe; only Delete performs cleanup.
